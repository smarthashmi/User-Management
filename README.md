User Management System Task
The User Management System is a web application that allows administrators to manage user accounts. It provides functionality for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting user records.
Features
Dashboard
The Dashboard is the main interface of the User Management System. It displays a table of user records with columns for name, email, and user since date. The dashboard also includes options to add new users, edit existing users, and delete users.
Add User
The Add User feature allows administrators to create new user accounts. It presents a form where administrators can enter the user's name, email, role, password, and confirm password. Once the form is submitted, the user record is sent to the server for creation. If successful, the user is added to the system, and a success message is displayed.
Edit User
The Edit User feature enables administrators to modify existing user accounts. By selecting the Edit option for a specific user in the dashboard, administrators are presented with a form pre-filled with the user's current information. They can then update the user's name, email, role, password, or confirm password. After submitting the form, the changes are sent to the server for updating the user record. If successful, the user record is updated, and a success message is displayed.
Delete User
The Delete User feature allows administrators to remove user accounts from the system. In the dashboard, administrators can select the Delete option for a specific user. A confirmation dialog is displayed to ensure that the deletion is intentional. If confirmed, a request is sent to the server to delete the user record. Upon successful deletion, the user is removed from the system, and a success message is displayed.
Pagination
The User Management System supports pagination to manage large sets of user records effectively. The table in the dashboard is paginated, and administrators can navigate through the pages using the paginator component. This ensures that the user interface remains responsive and optimized for performance.
Technologies Used
The User Management System is built using the following technologies and frameworks:
•	
•	Vue.js: A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
•	Axios: A JavaScript library for making HTTP requests to the server.
•	Bootstrap: A front-end framework for styling the user interface.
•	Font Awesome: A library of icons used for visual elements.
•	Paginator Component: A custom component built specifically for handling pagination.
